Being connected to a network involves hardware such as laptops, mobiles, desktops and servers. Even software for communication and work applications. Everyone is vulnerable to a cyber-attack. Businesses on the other hand are more likely to be targeted over an individual. The common threats are spyware, Trojans, virus, phishing and network intrusion. Deep learning is a state of the art new technology for cybersecurity. In this area of AI it incorporates machine learning, where the machines are able to learn from their experience and attain skills without human interaction. It is an algorithm that performs a task over and over again and each time it does there are changes to the outcome.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

We are at the point where virtual assistants are available now. Virtual assistants can be Siri, Alexa and Cortana. Service providers tend to incorporate deep learning to understand speech and the language that humans use when interacting with these virtual assistants. Websites back then did not have the option for the users to interact with a bot to provide customer service or get assistant. Whereas now majority of websites have chatbots and service bots available to assist users with their enquiry. By having these bots available for companies, it makes it easier for them to deal with customer assistance and the bots are able to respond in a helpful way due to the increase in auditory and text questions.</span></span></p>

The machine is able to translate majority of text typed or inserted however the meaning could vary depending on the context and how it is used. For basic use it is perfectly fine but if one wishes to use it for further gains it is not recommended. Deep learning is also used for facial recognition, not just for security purposes such as a two factor authentication.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Instead people will be able to pay with facial recognition, where the machines are able to determine the person based on their facial features such as eye colour, nose, hairstyle, beard, etc. However the current challenge as of now is to get facial recognition to identify people even if they have changes to their appearances. Such as with Apple devices, they incorporate facial recognition as one of their security features to unlock devices or either by entering a passcode.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

With more data they are able to absorb they better the result will be. With a driverless car it could be an uber. It has the similar features to a virtual assistant where it is able to understand what the users says and will execute the command. An example could be the car is driving and approaches a roundabout, it will be know when to stop and when to drive depending on the situation if there are any other vehicles in the vicinity, it would do the same thing that a regular drive would do. With this implemented self-driving cars will be able to adapt to road change situations and conditions along with also learning new road situations. To make this possible, the vehicles will require real time visual and sensor data.</span></span></p>

For online services it is unlikely to affect jobs but rather technology wise it is really good. The AI’s will develop over time and get better at understanding language and how to respond. Manufacturing jobs are most likely going to replace with AI’s as they are able to programme to repeat the same job over and over again, whereas with humans we have a limit and are only able to do so much.</span></span></p>

When it comes to getting assistance with a product or service online it is usually easier to interact with a human since they are able to understand what you are after, whereas a bot it could encounter walls and thus making it inconvenient for the user.</span></span></p>

Along with creating jobs and new roles within companies. However, for those in labour jobs, they have a higher chance to be replaced by AI. With automation it is good for economic as it reduces the prices on goods and services. However, it could cost people their jobs. And thus, result in creating more jobs but it depends on the profession.</span></span></p>

Delivery of shopping online now has skyrocketed to what it was back then. Since people no longer need to go to the shops in person they order online and get their package shipped to their doorstep or workplace.</span></span></p>

Rather with this development it does makes things easier and more convenient but there are downsides to it. In terms of autonomous vehicle for truck drivers it is not relevant since I’m in a different line of work. For online services this change will have a positive effect, since going in person to certain places for services take a long time with the queue, online makes it easier. All you require is the information and doesn’t require for you to be there physically.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

If this development does occur, it is much faster and more suitable for people. Though majority of people nowadays will pay with either electronic banking or using a physical card. Less people are paying with cash upfront now, as paying with card is easier and faster. Only downside to pay with card at certain stores is that they will often have surcharge, meaning you have to pay extra, that’s where cash would come into play if you prefer not to pay extra. Paying with credit card will offer you bonuses such as extra points but there is a limit on how much you spend and if it is not paid back by the given date there will be penalties.</span></span></p>

So in terms of online shopping and services they are highly likely to struggle and would prefer to go in person to get assistance. As for friends the effect it would have on them isn’t likely to be too dramatic since they are well-versed when it comes to technology.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Cloud servers are all over the world in data centre, the cloud server does not require you to manage the server in person unlike a server you have to be there physically to access. Current technology for the cloud that is state of the art is “iDrive”. As of now it is able to allow users to share files through social media and email along with the feature to restore previous backed up files. With backup this technology provides the user with a physical version of a hard drive disk. This is on the off chance that the user loses all their data due to unforeseen circumstances. The service that is provided for this type of technology is that it does not delete cloud files once you have deleted something from your hardware. Therefore the users are able to rest assured and don’t have to worry about losing valuable data if they remove it by accident.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Along with increased storage capacity. Since majority of companies require a service that allows for them to store their data. You can expect that security for cloud services will be improved dramatically. Data that is currently stored on the cloud is secured to a point but not completely secure, to the point that hackers are still able to break through security protocols and steal information from other people. To prevent future cyber attacks security will be a top priority. The set up for cloud is very good as it helps companies and businesses save a lot of money. If they did not go with cloud they’d be losing thousands.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

This includes, textbooks, workbooks, eBooks etc. As long as students have a device that is able to connect to the internet they are able to access everything they need. With the development of cloud technology USB, floppy disks, CD aren’t used much now as they were used in the past. In this day and age we have Dropbox, a service that offers user cloud storage, personal cloud, file synchronization and client software is very popular. Companies such as Apple, Google and Samsung have cloud feature also. All these features are free to use however if users require more storage space, they are required to pay a monthly subscription for extra storage depending on the provider. Each cloud feature suits each platform better such as apple’s iCloud is designed for apple/iOS users and whilst Microsoft OneDrive which is for pc users.</span></span></p>

The technology that has made cloud possible is smart phones, tablets, laptops, notebooks etc. When looking back, we are able to see that technology has developed a lot throughout the years with the release of tablets such as the iPad, Samsung galaxy tablet, Microsoft surface etc. As technology has been evolving, physical copies for software and hardware to install into computers are accessible through the cloud now. Previously for businesses in the past there was no option for cloud, so employees had to be at the company physically to work on documents and projects. However with the development of technology it is now possible to access everything via the cloud feature.</span></span></p>

It allows businesses to reduce the cost to maintain and manage their IT systems, also it is very efficient. With regular servers there is a chance to run into downtime, where the system encounters issues and requires someone to be present in order to resolve the issue. Whereas with the cloud the chances of downtime is very low and hardly occurs.</span></span></p>

Jobs are most likely not going to be redundant. There’s a high chance for creating new jobs and opening more opportunities for people. Older technology will be redundant by the time cloud develops.

In this case nothing can be done until the matter is resolved. It would also depend on the area I stay in, not all areas will have the best connection to internet, therefore there is a chance that access cloud may not be possible all the time. So have physical hard disk drives will be good for occasions such as this. One of the biggest differences about switching to cloud choosing a good provider. Since cloud runs via the internet, there are still chances that hackers could potentially steal vital information belonging to you. If a lot of people are accessing the cloud from the same server, there are chances that an attack may occur and thus resulting in the server going down and no one would be able to access it.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Previously people would be running applications, programs from software downloaded from the computer. Whilst with cloud it allows for people to access the exact same but via the internet. For family members they are not too well-versed when it comes to technology in this modern age. Cloud would prove some difficulties for them. An advantage of using cloud for family and friends is the great mobility it provides for us. Since cloud is accessible through the mobile, it is excellent for on the go. Few of my family members work in offices so this feature is excellent for them since if they can’t be in the office in person, cloud provides them access through mobile so they can use this to keep up to date with their work or co-workers.</span></span></p>

These vehicles are capable of doing such things due to the various technology and sensors it contains. The first autonomous vehicle was the Stanford cart from the 1980s to the 1960s which was used as a lunar rover. Now the autonomous vehicle company ‘Waymo’ is the current leading state of the art for this technology. Waymo is designed to function without a driver, their autonomous vehicles “operates a commercial self-driving taxi”(Fingas, 2018), users can download the Waymo mobile app similar to uber to then ask for an autonomous vehicle which is available 24/7, giving the users a driverless experience. The autonomous vehicle will arrive at the users starting point where they board the vehicle which it will then drive to their destination on auto pilot.</span></span></p>

This limitation is due to Waymo starting cautiously hoping to avoid collisions and easing the community into a driverless world (Fingas, 2018). Next, Waymo will slowly progress by continuing to test its autonomous vehicles in different environments and landscapes. So far, the company has been giving permission to test its vehicles completely driverless in California but unfortunately have not been permitted to test elsewhere. This is due to the public not having complete trust with driverless taxis as well as these autonomous vehicles not having enough training data. The perceived way to train an autonomous vehicle is to provide it with billions of hours of real driving and utilise this to teach the vehicle good driving behaviour (Piper, 2020). However, gaining this kind of data which is essential for the development of autonomous vehicles is hard as it is expensive. Also, encountering other learning experiences such car accidents or coming across obstacles such as debris on the road is very rare, making the progression of autonomous vehicles slow (Piper, 2020).</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Waymo uses a combination of sensors and systems such as LiDar system, Radar system, Vision system and supplemental sensors. By combining these technologies Waymo gives its vehicles the ability to see 360-degrees at the maximum distance of 300m (Andrew J, 2020), and in some circumstances see stop signs from as far as 500m away. The LiDar system is placed on top of the vehicle for 360-degree view while the other two LiDar systems are placed at the front of the car for perimeter vision and on the side for peripheral vision. The LiDar sends out a pulse of light collecting data of up to 4 different objects in the laser beams line of sight (Andrew J, 2020). This helps give a more detailed view of the environment. The vision system is a high-resolution camera which is primarily used for long range in both daylight and nightlight. This camera detects various different colours to help identify traffic lights as well as construction and road signs (Gibbs, 2020). The radar system utilises wavelengths, this radar helps identify movements in the proximity of the vehicle to avoid accidents (Gibbs, 2020). Lastly the Waymo autonomous vehicle uses a supplemental sensor, this is an audio detection sensor which is used as extra support to identify the sounds of emergency vehicle sirens which are very distant. The vehicle can use this information to prepare for when the emergency services near and act accordingly, such as pulling over or making way. Also, lastly the Waymo vehicle uses a GPS as a supplement to gain a better understanding of the location it currently resides so it is able to accurately understand the environment and landscape that it is going to be travelling in (Gibbs, 2020).</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Waymo’s technology has been game changing and is yet to have an impact. As the need for autonomous vehicles increase there will be a massive reduction in fossil fuels as autonomous vehicles run on electricity. This will reduce our carbon footprint which contributes to saving the environment (D'allegro, 2020). Another addition to the impact Waymo’s autonomous vehicles will have is contributing to making safer roads. It is stated that 94% of vehicle crashes is due to human errors or choices (Lori, 2020), so by increasing the number of autonomous vehicles and decreasing drivers behind the wheel will result in safer roads. But for Autonomous vehicles to be adopted into cities there will need to be changes in the infrastructure. These vehicles do not need the current wide lanes which modern day cars use, so in the near future these spaces can be freed up. The need for parking spaces is also going to be minimal as autonomous vehicles will drop their rider off at their destination then return to its base. The development of this new technology will affect oil companies as they profit predominantly from vehicles and modes of transportation which use this fossil fuel. As the need for autonomous vehicles increases the need for oil will decrease as there will be more electric powered cars on the road. However, the increase in this technology could affect current jobs. Businesses that cant adjust to the change will struggle as it is estimated that “hundreds of billions of dollars (if not trillions) will be lost by automakers, suppliers, dealers, insurers, parking companies, and many other car-related enterprises” (D'allegro, 2020). So, the result for the need of this technology will lead to the reduction of jobs in this field. However, as this technology progresses it is predicted to create over 100,000 mobility industry jobs in the next decade (Rayome, 2019). Also, an additional 30,000 jobs will be created for people with computer science-based degrees making the jobs in this field abundant.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

But there are cons to public transport such as delayed transport, overcrowding and you need to walk to the nearest bus stop or train station. These factors could contribute to you arriving late to your destination or not feeling comfortable in your mode of public transport. Waymo’s autonomous vehicles can eliminate that by coming straight to my door and driving me directly to my destination with ease. This would also be more preferred as its cheaper than a taxi and its safer than other ride share apps such as Uber or Didi as it is driverless, reducing the chances of people being harmed by drivers. The whole driverless experience will be different for me as it’s something new, it would take time for me to trust this technology as I haven’t experienced anything close to it before. On the contrary the technology being used, and the amount of testing being done makes it seem promising, so I plan on giving this technology a try. However, this would affect members of my family such as my father and brother as they are taxi and uber drivers. This will result in their job loss as the need for these jobs will decrease due to this new driverless technology.</span></span></p>

Robots are used in many industries to perform repetitive tasks and also used to work in environments hazardous to people such as disarming bombs and putting out fires. The ASIMO robot which stands for, Advanced Step In Innovative Ability, is the state of the art of this technology with its humanoid appearance and its ability to walk and climb up stairs (Staple, 2019). The ASIMO robot is the result of twenty years’ worth of robot research collected by Honda.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

The robot’s ability to walk and run has advanced to the extent where it is able to change its direction smoothly while moving. ASIMO has the ability to interpret simple voice commands and respond, it has learnt responses as simple as responding to its name when it is called. It is also capable of other abilities such as recognising objects, gestures, sounds and faces, this helps ASIMO interact with humans and act accordingly (Jason, 2011).</span></span></p>

Production, study and improvement of ASIMO was discontinued in 2018 but the advanced robot was still developing on certain movements such as jogging and jumping and recovering from sudden forces such as being shoved or pulled. Honda was working on this by implementing a new strategy where the robot takes longer and faster steps to recover from the forceful shoves (Ackerman, 2018). The focus of this is to help the robot keep balance, this will be achieved by providing ASIMO with information on how the human recovers from incidents. The development of ASIMO has been halted due to Honda wanting to use ASIMO’s technology for more practical research and to focus on nursing and road transport. In saying this it is not sure if the advanced humanoid robot will be making a comeback, but its technology has set the margin for robots.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

This study was used to accurately understand how the leg functions as well as the physiology. The robot contains many sensors and advanced technology to for it to function. ASIMO has the two sensors gyroscope sensor and speed sensor placed on its body. These sensors are responsible of keeping track of the position the body is in as well as the speed it travels in. These sensors perform to help keep the equilibrium of the robot like the inner ear of a human (Obringer, 2018). The robot has “floor surface sensors in its feet and six ultrasonic sensors in its midsection” (Obringer, 2018), these sensors make it possible for ASIMO to detect objects around itself and interact with its surrounding environment. The control of the posture and the reinforcement of the robot’s balance is handled by floor reaction control, target ZMP control and Foot-planting location control. The floor reaction control is focused on the feet and absorbs the unevenness of the landscape it walks on helping ASIMO to keep balance. The Target ZMP control is control of counterbalancing a fall when ASIMO is on the verge of falling over, this is achieved by ASIMO speeding up and moving its body in the opposite direction to stop a fall. The last bit of control technology ASIMO contains is Foot-planting location control. This control is activated when Target ZMP control is in use, this control adjusts the stride and step ASIMO takes to match the speed in steps and posture the robot has to be in to impend a fall.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

These advanced humanoid robots could save many lives in emergency situations such as fires, disarming bombs, natural disasters and many more similar situations. Its ability to replicate a human and complete similar task without being affected or harmed in action is what makes it ideal. ASIMO could be used to assist emergency services or be used as security systems and patrol 24/7 without having issues such as fatigue or tiredness. They could patrol schools and buildings and alert people of any threats making the world a safer place (Babe, 2009). However, it is not sure whether these changes will be put in place anytime soon due to the discontinuation of ASIMO. But if the robot was to be recontinued it would positively affect people with disabilities by assisting them in situations where they are incapable of doing. Such as assisting blind people by directing them or being an extra limb or two for handicappers. Although ASIMO and other humanoid robots would be an excellent addition to the current world we live in, it is stated that “that 35% of existing UK jobs are at high risk of replacement in the next 20 years from technology, automation and robotics” (Carter, 2015). This would significantly impact working people as there will be a loss of jobs due to robots taking the position of humans and also “lower-paid jobs (defined as below £30,000 a year, which is around $45,000, or AU$55,000) appear to be more than five times as likely to be replaced compared to higher-paid jobs” (Carter, 2015). So, if industries and businesses do not anticipate and prepare for such a change and adapt to the new technology there will be a massive increase in unemployment.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

If robots are introduced into the security field and are made to replace security officers, then I could suffer a potential job loss. However, if they are introduced into the security field as additional technology I can work alongside, then I believe it would have a good impact. There is always room for more technology in security as it makes things a lot safer for the community. So, in saying this I could potentially work alongside robots in the near future. If this was to happen this would be different to me as I am used to working alongside people so working alongside a robot would be a new experience for me. Robots would also be good technology for people of old age such as my father to own. Once people reach old age, they aren’t able to do simple tasks anymore such as bending over, reaching items which are placed too high and certain lifting. By having a robot such as ASIMO people of old age such as my father will have someone to assist them 24/7 with the tasks, they are no longer capable of completing.</span></span></p>
